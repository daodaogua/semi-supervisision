** What is semi-supervised learning [copy from https://github.com/wohlert/semi-supervised-pytorch]
Semi-supervised learning tries to bridge the gap between supervised and unsupervised learning by learning from both *labelled* and *unlabelled* data.

Semi-supervised learning can typically be applied to areas where data is easy to get a hold of, but labelling is expensive. Normally, one would either use an unsupervised method, or just the few labelled examples - both of which would be likely to yield bad results.

** 进展
- The current state-of-the-art method in semi-supervised learning achieves an accuracy of over 99% on the MNIST dataset using just 10 labelled examples per class.
