- disentangled representation
  - disentangled representation can be defined as one where singlelatent units are sensitive to changes in single generative factors, while being relatively invariant tochanges in other factors (Bengio et al., 2013).

- zero-shot inference
  - reasoning about new data is enabled by recombining previously learnt factors
